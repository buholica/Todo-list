## TODO LIST

Todo List offers an intuitive web-based solution to effortlessly manage personal tasks directly from the browser. Streamlining the workflow, it provides a seamless way to organize, prioritize, and monitor the to-dos with ease and efficiency.
## Features

* The List empowers users with essential task management capabilities, including the ability to seamlessly add and remove tasks, while also facilitating the transition of tasks from active to completed status. 
* Users can conveniently filter tasks based on their status, whether active, completed, or view all tasks at once. 
* Notably, while the current version employs a JSON file for task storage, upcoming iterations will introduce enhancements in data management for improved performance and flexibility.

## Technologies Used
* **Flask**: Handles the logic of the application.
* **Bootstrap**: Provides the design framework for an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
* **Jinja**: Facilitates dynamic templating for seamless integration of backend and frontend components.



## Additional Information

I utilized ["the 'Todo List' Bootstrap"](https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/bs4-todo-list) template as the foundation for this project, but I also incorporated several custom modifications throughout the development process.
